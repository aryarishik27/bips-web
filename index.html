    <h3>About this section:</h3>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>The countdown is there to motivate you, not to scare you!</li>
      <li>Remeber to use Clear Storage Button carefully. I hope you will not need it as it will delete all the entries of mock test. Line chart will get updated automatically. If you face any problem, just refresh it.</li>
      <li>I was thinking of making the progress tracker more sophisticated like by adding no. of daily hours spent but I feel that's not the way to go. I mean study hard but do not bind yourself.</li>
      <li>One more thing I would like to suggest is that solve as many questions as possible. I mean learn concepts through questions if possible. I don't know how it works in CFA but from personal experience this has helped me a lot. What you can do is apart from covering your material, try and solve fixed amount of questions per day. Quantification of questions help! </li>
      <li>In case you need any assistance with your course material or reference text or anything, feel free to use my ChatGPT account. It will literally solve any doubt or questions. It's just amazing! <br>

  <h3>Message from developer :)</h3>
  <p>I tried my best to keep this website minimal and a personal experience for you. It's just for you, I hope it will make you feel special :)</p>
  <p>And listen, it's okay to get stressed out sometimes. I mean it's not in our control. Just don't let it dictate terms. I would suggest to visit this website everytime you feel stressed. It might give you that extra little energy and motivation and of course it will make me feel happy :)</p>
  <p>Aur madam time manage ho jaayega, don't be too harsh on yourself. Tu itna kar paa rahi hai wo hi bahut badi baat hai. I can't even imagine working full time for 8 hours and then even think about studying. Hats off to you!</p>
  <p>If you need anyyyyy kind of help or support or if you are feeling low or just wanna have a little conversation about literally anything and everything, feel free to contact @<b>7073135695</b> at literally anytime! </p>
  <p>I am always there with you! I have probably told you this million times but I reallyyyyy mean it! &#10084;</p>
